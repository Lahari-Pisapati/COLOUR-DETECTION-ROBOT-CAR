# COLOUR-DETECTION-ROBOT
Opencv Python
A Robot car is controlled through by the detection of number of red colored blobs through webcam using Opencv in python. The number of blobs detected is communicated to Arduino Nano through PySerial and in turn Arduino Nano communicates the information for the movement of the car with Arduino uno using NRF24L01 module.
